Luck Points in FS3 can be used to generate various lucky breaks.  Luck points are earned through cookies (see `help cookies`).  You can view your available luck points on your character sheet.

You can use luck points for combat, ability rolls, or other plot points at the storyteller's discretion.

`luck/spend <points>` - Spends luck outside of combat.
    See `help combat luck` for combat-related luck commands.

For ability rolls, you can use a luck point to give yourself a +3 modifier to a single die roll.
