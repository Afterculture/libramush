# Events

The events system is an in-game calendar that lets you schedule events.

[[help events]]

Events are color coded based on how close they are.

* Green = within 24 hours
* Yellow = within 48 hours
* Bold = within 7 days

## Creating and Deleting Events

You can create and edit your own events.  Characters with the `manage_events` permission can edit other peoples' events too.
