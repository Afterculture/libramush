Those with board admin privileges are able to edit and delete other peoples' posts as well as their own.

Board admins can also create and delete boards:

    %xcbbs/createboard <name>%xn
    %xcbbs/deleteboard <board name or #>%xn
    
And set their descriptions as well as who can read or write(post) to them:

    %xcbbs/describe <board name or #>=<description>%xn
    %xcbbs/readroles <board name or #>=<roles that can read it, or 'everyone'>%xn
    %xcbbs/writeroles <board name or #>=<roles that can write to it, or 'everyone'>%xn
    
You can also change the order that the boards are displayed in by assigning each an order number:

    %xcbbs/order <board name or #>=<order #>
