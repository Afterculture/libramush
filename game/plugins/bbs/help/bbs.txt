The bulletin board system lets you stay posted on game news and events.  There are various %xhboards%xn available, each with a different purpose.  Some boards are restricted, and the system will tell you which boards you can read and which ones you can write (aka post) to.

Those familiar with %xh%xbMyrddin's BBS%xn from other MUSH systems should find that the commands you're used to (bbread, bbpost, etc.) also work here.

For all of the bbs commands, you can specify either the board name or number.

    %xcbbs%xn - Lists available boards.
    %xcbbs <board>%xn - Lists posts on the selected board.
    %xcbbs <board>/<post #>%xn - Reads the selected post.

    %xcbbs/post <board>=<subject>/<body>%xn - Writes a new post.
    %xcbbs/reply <board>/<post #>=<reply>%xn - Writes a comment as a reply to a post.

    %xcbbs/new%xn - Reads the first unread message.
    %xcbbs/catchup <board>%xn - Marks all unread messages as read.

You can also edit or delete your own posts.

    %xcbbs/edit <board>/<post #>%xn - Grabs the existing post text.
    %xcbbs/edit <board>/<post #>=<new text>%xn - Replaces post text with the new text.
    %xcbbs/delete <board>/<post #>%xn - Deletes a post
    %xcbbs/move <board>/<post #>=<new board>%xn - Moves a post from one board to another.
