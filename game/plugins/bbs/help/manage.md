# BBS - Manage Boards

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the permission: manage\_bbs

Those with board privileges can manage bulletin boards.

## Archiving a Board

You can archive the messages from a bulletin board for offline storage.  The default format is suitable for a wikidot wiki page.

`bbs/archive <board>` - Prints out messages so you can log them to a file.

## Editing, Moving and Deleting Posts

You can edit and delete other peoples' posts as well as their own.  You can also mass delete posts to clean up boards.

> **Tip:** It is recommended that you archive a board before doing a mass delete, as there is no 'undo'.  Deleted messages are permanently gone.

`bbs/delete <board>/<#>-<#>`
