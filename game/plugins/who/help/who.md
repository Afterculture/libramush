The `who` command shows you which other players are connected to the game and information about them.

`who` - Shows the who list.
`where` - Shows the who list including character locations.
`hide` and `unhide` - Controls whether your location shows up on the who list.
      There is no way in Ares to completely hide yourself from the who list or room
      descriptions (i.e. no dark/hidden power.)
