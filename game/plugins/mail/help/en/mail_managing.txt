You can delete mail messages.  Technically this doesn't delete it right away, but tags it as trash.  Messages tagged as trash are deleted when you log out.

    %xcmail/delete <#> or <start#>-<end#>%xn - Sends a message to the trash.
    %xcmail/undelete <#>%xn - Recovers a message from the trash.
    %xcmail/emptytrash%xn - Permanently deletes messages in the trash.
    
The archive feature lets you tag messages with keywords and then archive them so they don't clutter up your inbox. You can search for the tags to find them again later. Special tags include %xh"inbox"%xn, %xh"trash"%xn, %xh"sent"%xn and %xh"archive"%xn.

    %xcmail/archive <#>%xn - Archives a message.
    %xcmail/tag <#>=<tag>%xn - Assigns a tag to a message.
    %xcmail/untag <#>=<tag>%xn - Removes a tag from a message.
    %xcmail/tags%xn - Lists all your tags.
    %xcmail/filter <list of tags>%xn - Switches your view to show only 
         messages with matching tags.  This remains in effect until you switch back
         to the Inbox view.
    %xcmail/inbox%xn - Returns to the inbox view.

You can backup your mail before deleting it.

    %xcmail/backup%xn - Prints out your mail, which you can save to a log file.
