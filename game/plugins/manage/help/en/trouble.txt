Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to deal with troublesome players.  These commands will help.

     %xcboot <name>%xn - Forcibly disconnects someone from the game.
     %xcfindsite <name, host or IP>%xn - Shows someone's IP address and any similar 
         ones on other chars. Be aware, though, that many internet providers share blocks 
         of addresses, so even similar-looking ones may in fact be different people.
