AresMUSH considers "alts" to be charactrs who are linked to your %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read	bbposts	and mail notifications.

Handles are completely optional!  Because of this, your game may have other ways for you to declare if you have multiple characters (a request or wiki page, for instance.)  Consult your local game policies for details.
