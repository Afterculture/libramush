Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to deal with troublesome players.  These commands will help.

 `boot <name>` - Forcibly disconnects someone from the game.
 `findsite <name, host or IP>` - Shows someone's IP address and any similar 
         ones on other chars. Be aware, though, that many internet providers share blocks 
         of addresses, so even similar-looking ones may in fact be different people.
   Ares does not support a 'siteban' feature because too many people these days share IP address blocks.  Your odds of banning innocent people is high.  Instead there is the ability to configure (server-side) a list of suspect hosts or IP addresses.  This is done in the Login configuration.
