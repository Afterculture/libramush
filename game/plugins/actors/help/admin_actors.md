Admin can set actors for other characters or NPCs.  When doing a NPC, you just specify their name the same as you would a PC - just make sure it doesn't conflict with any PC names.

`actors/set <character>=<actor>` - Sets a character for a character or NPC.
`actors/delete <character>` - Delete's an actor.
