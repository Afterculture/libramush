# Channels

Channels are public forums for out-of-character communication.  Each game will have a variety of channels available for use.  Some will be locked so that only people with certain roles may use them.

## Command Quick Reference

`channels` - List channels and the commands to talk on them.
`channel/join <channel>[=<alias>]`
`channel/leave <channel>`
`<channelalias> <message>` - Talks on a channel.
`channel/who <channel>` - Shows who's on the channel
`channel/mute <channel> or channel/unmute <channel>` - Despams for awhile.
`channel/recall <channel>[=<num messages>]` - Shows the last few messages on a channel.

> **Tip:** AresMUSH also supports the MUX-style channel commands, so you can use the keywords "on", "off", "who", "last", "mute", and "unmute" with the channel alias.  For example:  `pub who`.
