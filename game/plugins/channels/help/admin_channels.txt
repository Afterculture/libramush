The channel administration commands are used to create, delete, and describe channels.

    %xcchannel/create <channel>%xn
    %xcchannel/delete <channel>%xn
    %xcchannel/describe <channel>=<description>%xn
    %xcchannel/color <channel>=<ansi prefix>%xn - Sets a channel's color.
        Use full ansi code(s) not just the color name.  For example: \%xc
        You can use multiple codes.  For example:  \%xh\%xr
    %xcchannel/roles <channel>=<roles>%xn
        Use "none" to clear existing roles.  
        Changing roles will remove anyone who is on the channel but doesn't 
        have the appropriate roles.
