The MUSH help system is here to help you learn how to play.  

Typing %xchelp%xn by itself will view a list of all available help topics, as well as additional help libraries that may be available.

Each library has its own command to view individual topics.  For the main player help library it is simply %xchelp <topic>%xn.  The command to access each library is listed on the main help display.

For more information on MUSH commands, see %xchelp commands%xn.

Note: AresMUSH does not distinguish between +help and help.  In fact, commands usually have no prefix at all.  You can type @desc, +desc or just 'desc' and it's all the same to the MUSH.
