# Outfits

The `outfit` command lets you manage multiple outfits for your character.  Typically you'll define one base outfit for your character's body description, and then have a variety of mix-and-match clothing outfits for your different clothes and accessories.

You can wear a combination of outfits using the `wear` command.  This will set your description to the selected outfits.
