# Looking Around

The `look` command is used to look around.  You can also look at a particular object or a detail on an object.

[[help look]]

## Glancing

The `glance` command gives you a quick summary of everyone in your room.  This will show some of your demographic information and your short description.

[[help glance]]

## Description Notifications

By default, the game will notify you if someone looks at you. (the @adesc feature from other MU servers.) If you don't like that, you can turn it off:

[[help desc/notify]]
