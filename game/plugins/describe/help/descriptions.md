Every character, room and exit has a description that tells you what you see when you look at it.

`describe <name>=<description>`
`describe/edit <name>` - Grabs the existing description into your input 
       buffer (if your client supports it.  See `help edit`.)
 You can set a shorter description that is used whenever an at-a-glance description is needed.

`shortdesc <name>=<description>`
`shortdesc/edit <name>` - Grabs the existing description into your input 
       buffer (if your client supports it.  See `help edit`.)

You can also have multiple outfits for your character, and have more detailed views that are separate from your main description.  See:

`help outfits`
`help details`
