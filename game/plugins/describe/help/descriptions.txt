Every character, room and exit has a description that tells you what you see when you look at it.  You can set this using the %xhdesc%n command.

   %xcdescribe <name>=<description>%xn

You can set a shorter description that is used whenever an at-a-glance description is needed.

   %xcshortdesc <name>=<description>%xn

You can also have multiple outfits for your character, managed using the %xhoutfits%xn command.  See %xchelp outfits%xn for more information.

The %xhlook%xn command is used to look around.

   %xclook <name>%xn
   %xclook%xn  (shortcut for looking at 'here')
