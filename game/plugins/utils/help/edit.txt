Many commands support an /edit switch, which allows you to easily grab game text into your client's input buffer (the place where you type).  For example, typing %xhdesc/edit me%xn will put your description into your input buffer so you can edit it and send it right back.  Not every command supports editing.

This feature takes only works if your MU client supports grab/FugueEdit functionality.  When the client sees text with a special prefix in front, it sends the text to your input buffer instead of to your screen.

Different clients expect different prefixes, and some let you set a custom one (sometimes called a 'grab password').  You can tell Ares what prefix to use for the edit commands.

    %xcedit/prefix <prefix>%xh - Sets your grab/edit prefix.
