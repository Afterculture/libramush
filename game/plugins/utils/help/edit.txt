Many commands support an /edit switch, which allows you to easily grab game text into your client's input buffer to edit it.  For example, typing %xhdesc/edit me%xn will put your description into your input buffer like so:  %xhdescribe me=<Your desc would be here.>%xn.  Not every command supports editing.

This feature takes the place of the /grab or @dec/tf functionality you might be familiar with from other games, and only works right if your MU client supports the old grab/FugueEdit functionality.  

Many clients allow you to set a grab password for security.  If you do this, you must set a matching password in ares.

    %xcedit/password <password>%xh - Sets your grab/edit password.
