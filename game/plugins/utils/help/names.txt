Once you set your character name, you cannot change it yourself.  You must contact an admin.  Why?  Your character's name is your identity.  Changing it without good reason will confuse everyone who knows you, so it requires special permission.

One thing you can change, though, is your nickname, or alias.  A character can have a single alias, and you can use it anywhere that you use a character's name.

    %xcalias <name>%xn - Sets your alias.  Leave blank to clear it.
