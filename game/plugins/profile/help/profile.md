Your profile is used to view OOC information about other characters. 

Each character has a **character profile** that is unique to that particular game. If you have a handle, people viewing your character profile may also see a link to your handle profile depends on your handle privacy settings (see %xhhelp handles` for more info.)

`profile <name or handle>`

You can set custom profile fields, which can display standard MUSH formatting codes (like ansi and linebreaks).  See `help formatting`.   

`profile/add <field>=<value>` - Adds or updates a custom profile field
`profile/delete <field>` - Deletes a custom profile field
`profile/edit <field>` - Snags the field into your input buffer, if
       your client allows.  (see `help edit`)
