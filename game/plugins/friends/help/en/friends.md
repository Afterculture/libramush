# Friends

The Friends system helps you to interact with people you have designated as your friends.

[[help friends]]
[[help friend/add]]
[[help friend/remove]]
[[help friend/note]]

You can use the friends list to control whose connect/disconnect messages you see.  See [Watch](/help/watch).

If you have an AresMUSH Player Handle, you can add other players as your friends at AresCentral.  These friendships will apply to all Ares games, so you can easily find out which of your friends are playing here.  For more information on player handles, see: [AresMUSH Handles Tutorial](http://aresmush.com/handles/).
