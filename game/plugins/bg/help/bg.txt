The most important part of a character is their background. We are not looking for a novel, just a couple paragraphs describing the characterâ€™s backstory.  In particular, your background should cover:
    
* Who is your character?
* Why are they here?
* Anything noteworthy about your character, particularly things that could serve as RP hooks.

The easiest way to edit your background is to type it in an offline program, like notepad, and paste it in.

    %xcbg/set <background>%xn - Sets your background.
    %xcbg/edit%xn - Grabs the existing background text into your input 
       buffer (if your client supports it.  See %xhhelp edit%xn.)
       
You can view your background on your character sheet.  See %xhhelp sheet%xn.

Character submission and approvals are part of the chargen commands.  See %xhhelp chargen%xn.  Once your character has been approved, you will no longer be able to edit your background.  Contact staff if you need to make changes after approval.

%xrWhy can't I break up my super-long BG into pages?%xn
Because we don't need or want super-long BGs.  The background system is not meant to capture every last detail of your character's life story - only the important bits.  If you can't condense the information into a manageable size, then chances are you have too many super-special things in your background.  You are more than welcome to provide supplemental character information on the game wiki, but the BG system isn't the place for it.
