%xhPosing%xn is the term for communication that happens between characters who occupy the same MUSH room.  This is the 'meat' of the game, the descriptions of character speech and actions that make up the story. There are several commands for posing, some of which add your character's name and other text to the message automatically as a convenience.

`say Hello!%xn or %xc"Hello!` - Bob says, "Hello!"
`pose waves.%xn or %xc:waves.` - Bob waves.
`;'s hair is black.` - Bob's hair is black.
`emit Go Bob!%xn or %xc\Go Bob!` - Go Bob!

Lastly, the %xhpemit%xn command lets you make a private emit to certain characters.

`pemit <list of names>=<message>`
    
Emit poses are normally anonymous to maintain the flow of the RP text.  Unfortunately, that means they can be abused by spammers.  If you're getting rogue messages, you can turn on your "nospoof" setting to identify emits and report the offender to the admin.

`nospoof <on or off>`
