The repose system keeps track of poses so you can catch up on what you've missed.   Poses and pose order are automatically cleared every hour if there's nobody logged into the room.

`repose` - View catchup poses.
`repose/order` - Shows the pose order of the room.

You can disable the system temporarily to keep a scene private.

`repose/on` or `repose/off` - Turns the system on or off in a room.

If you start a new scene and there are remnants from an old one, you can clear the old poses and pose order.

`repose/clear`
