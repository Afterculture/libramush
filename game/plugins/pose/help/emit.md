# Emits

Emits allow you to send messages to the room you're in.  There are a variety of commands that will 

`say Hello!` or `"Hello!` - Bob says, "Hello!"
`pose waves.` or `:waves.` - Bob waves.
`;'s hair is black.` - Bob's hair is black.
`emit Go Bob!` or `\Go Bob!` - Go Bob!

## Private Emits

The `pemit` command lets you make a private emit only to certain characters.

`pemit <list of names>=<message>`

## Nospoof

Emit poses are normally anonymous to maintain the flow of the RP text.  If someone is abusing this privilege, you can turn on your "nospoof" setting to identify emits and report the offender to the admin.

`nospoof <on or off>`
