# AresCentral - Games Directory

The game will automatically register itself with AresCentral the first time it starts up, using the game info you specified during installation.  You can update this info at any time using the Web Portal's "Game Setup" screen.

Each game is assigned a unique API Key, which is like a password used to secure communications between the game and AresCentral.
