# Watching Other Characters Connect

You will always be notified when people log in to the room you're in.  However, it can also be handy to know when people are coming and going across the game.

## Connection Notifications

The game can tell you when people have connected and disconnected by saying: "SoAndSo has connected."  You can turn these messages on or off, or have it only notify you when your friends come and go. See [Friends](/help/friends) for more info on managing your friends list.

## Last Online

You can use the `last` command to see when someone was last online.
