The MUSH help system is here to help you learn how to play.

`help, help2, help3, etc.` - Shows each page of help topics.
    Note:  Many commands work this way, showing a "page x of y" message at the bottom of the command text.
`help <topic name>` - Views a help topic.

Some games have additional help libraries, like for admins or builders.  You'll see a list on the main help display, and can access those libraries similarly to how you access the main help.  For example, admin help is:

`ahelp` - Lists admin help topics
`ahelp <topic name>` - Views an admin help topic.
