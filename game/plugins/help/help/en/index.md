# Help System

If you are looking for basic help about how the game is played, check out the [MUSH 101 Tutorial](http://www.aresmush.com/mush-101)

The MUSH help system is here to help you learn how to use the in-game commands.  On the game's [Web Portal](http://localhost:8181) you will find detailed tutorials about all the major systems.  Inside the game itself, you can type `help <command name>` to get the syntax for how to use a particular command. 

> **Tip:** Type `website` to get the address for the Web Portal.

Command arguments appear in brackets like <command name>.  So to get help on the mail command you would type `help mail`.  Sometimes arguments are optional.  Optional arguments are indicated with square brackets.

> **Tip:**  Many commands show a "page x of y" message at the bottom of the command text.  You can use a number after the command name to see each page - e.g., help, help2, help3, etc.  This works with commands that have switches too, so you can do requests2/all.
