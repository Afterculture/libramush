Admin have some extra commands for getting around the grid without using the normal exits.

    %xcteleport <destination>%xn - Teleports yourself.
    %xcteleport <list of names>=<destination>%xn - Teleports a character.
        
Note: In either case, 'destination' can be a room name, room database ID, or player name

If you're not sure of the room name or ID, you can use the rooms directory command.
    
    %xcrooms%xn - Shows all rooms and their database IDs.
    %xcrooms <name>%xn - Searches for a room matching the given name.
