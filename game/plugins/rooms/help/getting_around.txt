The MUSH grid consists of %xhRooms%xn connected by %xhExits%xn.  There are a number of ways to get around the grid.

The room description shows available exits.  You can use the %xhgo%xn command to move through an exit, or just use the exit name as a shortcut.  For example:  "go n" or simply "n".

    %xcgo <exit name>%xn or %xc<exit name>%xn - Move through an exit

You can also set a room to be your character's home, and go straight there from anywhere on the grid:

    %xchome/set%xn - Set your home.
    %xchome%xn - Goes home.
    
You can easily meet other characters for RP using the %xhmeetme%xn command.  See %xchelp meetme%xn for more information.
