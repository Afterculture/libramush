Admin have some extra commands for getting around the grid without using the normal exits.

`teleport <destination>` - Teleports yourself.
`teleport <list of names>=<destination>` - Teleports a character.
        
Note: In either case, 'destination' can be a room name, room database ID, or player name

If you're not sure of the room name or ID, you can use the rooms directory command.
    
`rooms` - Shows all rooms and their database IDs.
`rooms <name>` - Searches for a room matching the given name.
