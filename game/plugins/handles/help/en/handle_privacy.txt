Handles are completely optional. The most extreme privacy setting is simply to avoid the system altogether.  You will still be able to access all of the traditional MUSH features, just as you would on Penn/Tiny.  You can also keep certain characters private(*) by simply not linking them to your handle. 
 
Even if you do link characters to your handle, you get to choose who can see that link. This setting is %xhper-character%xn, so you can have some public and keep others close to your vest.

%xh%xgPublic%xn - Everyone will see this character listed on your handle profile.  Anyone can access your handle profile through your character name (e.g. 'profile Cate' will bring up the profile for @Faraday).  Your handle name will show up in certain OOC commands (like channels and who list).  

%xh%xyFriends-Only%xn - Only people on your friends list will see this character listed on your handle profile.  Only your friends can access your handle profile through your character name. Your handle name will NOT show up in OOC commands.  

%xh%xrPrivate%xn(*) - Nobody will see this character listed on your handle profile, or be able to access your handle profile through your character name.

Why is there a (*) by "private" up above?  Because true privacy on a MUSH is an illusion.  Remember that the admins of any game you log into have have access to your IP address, the game database, and anything you type.  It's not that hard to identify alts even without handles.  AresCentral admins are bound by our privacy policy (viewable on aresmush.com), but you should check the policies on your other games.

Links default to friends-only, and you can change it at any time.
