Handles are completely optional. The most extreme privacy setting is simply to avoid the system altogether.

But it doesn't have to be all or nothing.  Even if you have a handle, you can keep a particular character private by simply not linking that character to your handle.

And even if you link characters to your handle, you get to choose who can see that link. This setting is per-character.

* %xhPublic%xn - Everyone can see this character linked to your handle.
* %xhFriends%xn - Only people on your friends list will see this character linked to your handle.
* %xhAdmin%xn - Only game admin will see this character linked to your handle. AresCentral admin(s) are bound by our Privacy Policy and will not misuse your handle information. Check the privacy policies of your other games if you're concerned about your local game admins.

Links default to friends-only, and you can change it at any time.
