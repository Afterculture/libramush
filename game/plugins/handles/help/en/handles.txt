Handles are an experiment in social media for MUSHing. A handle is your OOC identity. It represents you, the player. You can link characters to your handle - even across multiple games - so that other players know who you are.

Handles are completely optional. If you don't have one, you'll still have access to all the basic MUSH features, same as on Penn/Tiny.  It doesn’t have to be all or nothing, though. There are privacy settings.
