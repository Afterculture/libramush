You can display your handle name to let others know your OOC identity.  Handles are only displayed if your character's handle privacy setting is "public".

Handles are shown like an extra alias, with an "@" sign in front to distinguish them from character names.

    %% (to Bob): Cate (@Faraday) says, "Hello!"
    <Public> Cate (@Faraday) says, "Hello!"
    
Sometimes people use a special OOC alt, for the sole purpose of hanging out OOC and keeping OOC chatter confined to a single window.  Staffers may do this too.  You can hide the character name and show only the handle by marking the character as OOC-only.

    %xchandle/ooc <on or off>%xn - Designates this as an OOC-only character
            
    %% (to Bob): @Faraday says, "Hello!"
    <Public> @Faraday says, "Hello!"
