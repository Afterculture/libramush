You can display your handle name to let others know your OOC identity.  Handles are only displayed if your character's handle privacy setting is "public".

Handles are shown like an extra alias, with an "@" sign in front to distinguish them from character names.  So if the character Cate is linked to the handle @Faraday, a page from Cate would show up like so:

    %% (to Bob): @Faraday (Cate) says, "Hello!"
    <Public> @Faraday (Cate) says, "Hello!"
