There are a number of ways you can use handles.  However, your use is limited by the other person's privacy settings (%xhhelp handle privacy%xn).

You can add a handle to your friends list (%xhhelp friends%xn).  IF you pass their privacy settings, you will see their connection status and connection messages on all their characters.

If someone's handle is public, you can use their handle to contact them via pages.

Sometimes people use a special OOC alt, for the sole purpose of hanging out OOC and keeping OOC chatter confined to a single window.  Staffers may do this too.  You can route any handle chatter to a particular character by setting it as your 'main' handle char.
