Pages are private messages sent between players.  You can page any number of people at once, and use the standard pose formats in the message (like : and ;).

    %xcpage <list of names>=<message>%xn
    
If you don't want to be bothered by pages, you can mark yourself as 'do not disturb' and incoming pages will be routed to mail instead.

    %xcpage/dnd <on or off>%xn
    
If you are very idle or marked Away From the Keyboard, people paging you will be notified that you may not respond right away.  You can control the specific message they receive using the 'afk' command.
