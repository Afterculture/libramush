Cookies are a fun way to appreciate your fellow players for playing with you.  Whereas some games use serious systems with nominations or votes, cookies are entirely frivolous.  Had fun?  Give a cookie.  Cookies are tallied and awarded weekly; you can only give someone a single cookie each week.  Cookies also help you earn luck points (`help luck`).

`cookie <list of names>` - Give a cookie.
`cookie/here` - Give cookies to everyone in the room (handy for big scenes)
`cookies` - Sees cookies you have given and received.
