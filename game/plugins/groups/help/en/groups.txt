Instead of having separate systems for "faction" and "position" and whatnot, AresMUSH treats these all as %xhGroups%xn.  The exact groups will vary on each game, so use the 'groups' command to see the list.  Groups may not be changed after you've been approved.

    %xcgroups%xn - Lists groups.
    %xcgroup <name>%xn - Describes a group and shows valid values.

Each group typically has its own command to set your affiliation.  For instance, if there's a group named "positon" then there should be a "position" command.  There's also a generic 'group/set' command that works with any group.

    position Cowboy --or-- group/set position=Cowboy
    faction Red --or--  group/set faction=Red
    
    Leave the vaule blank to clear it.

You can use the census command to find out how many characters there are from each group.

    %xccensus <group>%xn - Counts characters from the group.
