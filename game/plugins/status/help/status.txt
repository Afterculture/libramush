Your character status is a general reflection of what you're doing on the game, and can be one of:

    IC (in character)
    OOC (out of character)
    AFK (away from keyboard)
    NEW (a new character who has not been approved)
    ADM (admin on duty - admins only)

You can set your status directly using the status command.

    %xcstatus <status>%xn - Sets your status.

The game has IC and OOC zones of the grid, but your status is independent of what zone you're in.  You can be OOC in an IC zone (NPCing or watching), or IC in an OOC zone (typically in a RP Room).  There are some shortcut commands to adjust your status and hop between zones.

    %xcic%xn - Sets your status to IC and travels to the IC zone.
    %xcooc%xn - Sets your status to OOC and travels to the OOC zone.
    %xcafk [<note>]%xn - Sets your status to AFK (does not move you).  The optional note
       could be something like 'getting dinner BRB', and is displayed in the room and when
       someone pages you.  This afk note is reset as soon as you change your status.

%xrGetting Stuck OOC%xn 
In rare circumstances, the various movement commands can cause you to become stuck in the OOC zone, unable to return IC.  When this happens, simply use:  %xhic/reset%xn.
