Admins can view and edit other character backgrounds, in case you need to make simple tweaks during the approval process.

`bg/set <name>=<background>` - Sets your background.
`bg/edit <name>` - Grabs the existing background text into your input 
       buffer (if your client supports it.  See `help edit`.)
 You can view someone's background on their character sheet.  See `help sheet`.
