# Character Creation

Character creation (aka chargen) here works a little differently than what you might be used to from other games.  Instead of being a series of rooms, it is a multi-step tutorial that guides you through the necessary setup.  

To start chargen, type `cg/start`.  You can access the chargen commands from anywhere on the game.

## Command Quick Reference

`chargen/start` - Starts chargen.
`cg/next` and `cg/prev` - Navigates the stages in chargen.
`cg` - View the current chargen page again.
`bg` - View your background.
`bg/set <background>` - Sets your background.
`bg/edit` - Grabs the existing background text into your input buffer.
`app` - Shows a summary of your character application and any issues.
`app/submit` - Submits your application.
`app/unsubmit` - Un-submit your application.
