Character creation (aka chargen) here works a little differently than what you might be used to from other games.  Instead of being a series of rooms, it is a multi-step tutorial that guides you through the necessary setup.  

To start chargen, type `chargen/start`.  You can access the chargen commands from anywhere on the game.

You can use `cg/next` and `cg/prev` to navigate through the stages of chargen.  To view the current stage instructions again, just type `cg`.
