Admins with appropriate permissions can approve and reject character applications.  These commands tie in with the character's approval job in the Jobs System.  Approving a character closes the job.  Rejecting a character puts it into a pending state until they re-submit.

`app <name>` - Reviews someone's application, showing any chargen errors or warnings.
`app/approve <name>`
`app/reject <name>=<message>` - Unlocks them so they can make changes.
`app/unapprove <name>` - Unapproves someone who was accidentally approved.
