This game uses an Applications system for character approvals.  Once you have finished with Character Creation (see %xh'help chargen'%xn), you can review your application.  The system will flag common issues.

    %xcapp%xn - Shows a summary of your character application and any issues.
     
After you submit your character for approvals, app staff will review it and get back to you soon.  Once your app is submitted, you cannot make further changes using the chargen commands.

    %xcapp/submit%xn - Submits your application.

If you realize you need to change something, you can withdraw your application.  Make the necessary changes using the chargen commands, and submit again when you're ready.

    %xcapp/withdraw%xn - Withdraw your application.
