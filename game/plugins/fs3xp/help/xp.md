Experience Points (XP) are used to improve your character after chargen. Players receive XP each week.  Admins may also award bonus XP for special training situations.  

You can spend XP to raise skills, interests and languages.  

Aptitudes reflect innate abilities your character was born with and will only change due to drastic plot developments (disability, genetic manipulation, etc.) at the discretion of the Storyteller.  

Expertise and Advantages require special approval to change, so contact the admin via a `request`.  XP costs may vary.

There are limits to how many XP you can save up, and how fast you can spend them.  This prevents people from making significant leaps overnight.

`xp/costs` - Shows the general cost table and limits on XP spending.
`xp/raise <skill>` - Spends XP to raise a skill.
`xp/lang <language>` - Spends XP to learn a language.
`xp/interest <interest>` - Spends XP to learn an interest.
