Ares will display all dates and times according to your local timezone.  Your timezone is set when you first log in, and you can change it at any time using:

`timezone <name>` - Sets your timezone.

You can use pretty much any timezone in the "tz database" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), or the common American ones (EST, CST, MST, PST).

The `time` command shows you a few bits of time-related information, including your local time.  You can compare this to your wall clock to make sure your timezone is set correctly.

For information on the IC time in the game, see `help ictime`.
