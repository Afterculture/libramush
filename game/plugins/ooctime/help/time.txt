Ares will display all dates and times according to your local timezone.  Your timezone is set when you first log in, and you can change it at any time using:

    %xctimezone <name>%xn - Sets your timezone.
    
You can use pretty much any timezone in the "tz database" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), or the common American ones (EST, CST, MST, PST).

The %xhtime%xn command shows you a few bits of time-related information, including your local time.  You can compare this to your wall clock to make sure your timezone is set correctly.

For information on the %xhIC%xn time in the game, see %xhhelp ictime%xn.
