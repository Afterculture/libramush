# Managing the Roster

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the permission: manage\_roster

Players with the necessary permissions can add and remove people from the roster.  You can optionally include a contact person and a short note about the roster character.  

[[help roster/add]]
[[help roster/remove]]
[[help roster/notes]]

## Restricted Characters

Roster characters normally are just claimed with no fanfare using the `roster/claim` command.  For special characters, you may want to require people to talk to the contact person and/or submit an application.  Characters marked as 'restricted' can't be claimed via a simple command.

[[help roster/restrict]]

When someone wants to claim a restricted character, staff will have to manually remove them from the roster, reset their password, and send the password to the new player somehow.
