All skills are "Ruled" by a certain attribute, which is the default attribute added to a skill when you roll it.  For example, if the ruling attribute for Firearms is "Reaction", then:

    roll Firearms -->  really means --> roll Firearms+Reaction

With action skills, the ruling attribute is set by the game admin.  With background skills, you can pick which attribute is used.

     %xcrulingattr <skill>=<attribute>%xn - Sets the ruling attribute
     
Ruling attributes are shown on your character sheet next to the skill rating.  For example, the (R) next to Firearms shows that its ruling attribute is Reaction:

     Firearms:          (R) @@
     
Note that no matter what the skill's ruling attribute is, you can always override it during a particular roll.  To remember the effective range of a particular sniper rifle, you might want to do:

    roll Firearms+Mind
