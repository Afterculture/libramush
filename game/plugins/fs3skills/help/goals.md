To help you flesh out your character, FS3 requres you to set Goals and RP Hooks.

Goals are things that will drive your character in RP.  Are they looking for a job?  Wanting to open their own business?  Hoping to avenge their father's murder? 

`goal/add <title>=<description>` and `goal/remove <title>`

RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can "hook" into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you.  Looking around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.
