This game uses the FS3 skills system.  Complete documentation can be found on the game wiki.  This is a quick reference for the commands used to make an ability roll.

    %xcroll <ability>%xn
    %xcroll <character>/<ability> vs <character>/<ability>%xn - Makes an opposed roll.
    
Typically you will roll a skill.  The attribute value is factored in automatically based on the ruling attribute.  (e.g. roll Firearms)

You may specify an attribute directly if you want to use a different ruling attribute.  (e.g. roll Mind+Firearms)

You may roll an attribute by itself.  This will actually roll TWICE the number of attribute dice, since attributes are only rated from 1-4.  (e.g. roll Mind)

You can apply a + or - modifier.  The modifier increases or decreases your ability rating, adding or subtracting dice.  (e.g. roll Firearms-1)
