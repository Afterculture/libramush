The FS3 Abilities commands are used to set yourself up during character creation.  To get started, or at any point you wish to reset yourself, use the reset command.

`reset` - Resets your abilities, setting default values based on your groups.
         %xh%xrThis will erase any abilities you have, so do this first!%xn

At any time you can check your current status and progress using the %xhsheet%xn and %xhapp%xn commands.

Use the Abilities command to see the ratings, available abilities and descriptions.

`abilities` - Everything you want to know about abilities.
 
Action Skills and Advantages have ratings from 1-5.  To set them, use these commands:    
    
`raise <name>%xn and %xclower <name>` - Raise or lower by 1 level.
`ability <name>=<level>` - Sets the rating
    
Aptitudes are special.  You get to pick 1 you're Great at, 1 you're Good at, and 1 you're Poor at:

`aptitude <great ability>/<good ability>/<poor ability>`
    
Expertise, Interests and Languages do not have ratings.  You merely add or remove them from the list.

`language/add <language>%xn and %xclanguage/remove <language>`
    Likewise for %xcexpertise%xn %xcinterest%xn
