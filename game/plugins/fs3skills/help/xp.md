Experience Points (XP) are used to improve your character after chargen. Players receive XP each week.  Admins may also award bonus XP for special training situations.  

You can spend XP to raise skills, interests and languages.  

Abilities are frozen for some time immediately after you exit chargen, and any time you raise them. You cannot raise them while theyâ€™re frozen.

`xp/costs` - Shows the general cost table and limits on XP spending.
`xp/raise <ability>` - Spends XP to raise an ability.
