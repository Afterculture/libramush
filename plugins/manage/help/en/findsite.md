## Findsite

The findsite command will help you find characters with similar IP address, which may be alts of one another.

> **Tip:**  Many internet providers use dynamic/block IP addresses, which means that some players who live geographically close to each other (including, obviously, roommates) may end up with the same host name or IP.

`findsite` - Shows a site summary identifying possible alts.
`findsite <name, host or IP>` - Shows someone's IP address and any similar ones.
